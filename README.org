* Interacting with Idris from Racket

This is the start of a library for interacting with Idris in graphical
Racket applications. It uses Idris's [[http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/reference/ide-protocol.html][IDE protocol]] to communicate with
the compiler, just like =idris-mode= for Emacs and the Atom plugin do.

My main motivation is to have something better than Emacs for doing
slide shows with compiler interaction.

** Current features
 - Start an Idris process and communicate over a socket
 - Parsing and unparsing Idris messages
 - Demo REPL app

** Planned
 - Proper translation between Idris error results and Racket
   exceptions
 - Graphical classes (snips) for Idris's semantic highlighting
 - Interaction with =slideshow=
 - Interactive editing features like those in =idris-mode=

** Not planned, but patches welcome
 - =#lang idris= in DrRacket
 - Full-featured editor support, with doc lookup, etc.
 - Compiling and running Idris programs from Racket
 - Interactive prover/elaborator support

** How to test
First, if Idris isn't on your PATH, then edit the invocation of
=subprocess= to point at its absolute path. Then, load up the file in
=racket-mode= or DrRacket and evaluate =(repl)= to get a bare-bones
graphical Idris REPL.
